# Welcome to Atlas GraphQL!
#
# This is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and
# testing GraphQL queries.
#
# Type queries into this side of the screen, and you will see intelligent
# typeaheads aware of the current GraphQL type schema generated for your
# application.
#
# Queries typically start with a "{" character. Lines that start
# with a # are ignored.
#
# You can use the Documentation Explorer to the right to see what types
# are available for you to query for your application.
#
# If nothing is appearing in the Documentation Explorer, you may need
# to resolve some warnings or errors before using GraphQL. A sample query
# for the Cake type has been generated for you below.
#
#
# Keyboard shortcuts:
#
#  Prettify Query:  Shift-Ctrl-P (or press the prettify button above)
#
#     Merge Query:  Shift-Ctrl-M (or press the merge button above)
#
#       Run Query:  Ctrl-Enter (or press the play button above)
#
#   Auto Complete:  Ctrl-Space (or just start typing)
